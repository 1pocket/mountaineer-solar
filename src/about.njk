    <h2>About Mountaineer Solar</h2>
    <p>We believe every West Virginian deserves an honest, easy path to solar energy. Mountaineer Solar is a solar marketplace built for the Mountain State &mdash; we connect homeowners, farmers, and businesses with vetted local installers who know our hills, our weather, and our grid.</p>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>We don't install panels &mdash; we make sure you find the right people who do. When you submit your information, we match your project with up to three qualified, local solar companies. You compare their proposals and choose what fits. No pressure, no obligation.</p>

    <h3>Why Mountaineer Solar?</h3>
    <ul class="ticks">
      <li><strong>Local knowledge.</strong> We know WV utility rates, net metering rules, and terrain challenges. Our partner installers do too.</li>
      <li><strong>Vetted pros only.</strong> Every installer in our network is licensed, insured, and experienced with West Virginia projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Free for homeowners.</strong> Our service costs you nothing. We're compensated by installer partners, not by you.</li>
      <li><strong>No-pressure process.</strong> Get quotes, compare, and decide on your own timeline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Mountaineer Name</h3>
    <p>In West Virginia, "Mountaineer" means something. It means grit, self-reliance, and taking care of your own. We built this marketplace because Mountain State families deserve the same access to clean energy savings that the rest of the country gets &mdash; matched with people who understand our communities.</p>
