    <p>Mountaineer Solar ("we," "us," "our") operates mountaineersolar.com as a <strong>lead generation and matching service</strong>. We connect consumers with independent, third-party solar installation companies ("Installers"). <strong>We are not a solar installer, contractor, or energy provider.</strong> We do not design, sell, install, or maintain solar energy systems.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>3. What We Provide</h3>
    <p>We provide a free service that matches your project details with up to three solar installation companies in your area. Our solar savings calculator provides <strong>estimates only</strong> &mdash; actual system design, pricing, and savings depend on a professional site evaluation.</p>
