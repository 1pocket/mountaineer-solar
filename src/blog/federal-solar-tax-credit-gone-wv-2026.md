If you've been researching solar panels for your West Virginia home, you've probably seen references to a 30% federal tax credit. That incentive — formally called the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) — was one of the biggest financial drivers behind residential solar adoption across the country.

**As of January 1, 2026, the residential solar ITC is no longer available.**

Here's what changed, what options remain, and whether solar still makes financial sense for WV homeowners.

## What Happened to the Solar Tax Credit?

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 had extended the 30% residential solar tax credit through 2032. However, the "One Big Beautiful Bill" legislation signed in mid-2025 repealed the residential clean energy credit effective December 31, 2025.

This means if you install a solar system in 2026 or later, you **cannot** claim the 30% federal tax credit on your personal income taxes for a purchased system.

## Are There Any Federal Incentives Left?

Yes, but they apply to specific situations:

- **Solar Leases and PPAs:** If a solar company owns the system and leases it to you (or sells you the power through a Power Purchase Agreement), the business that owns the equipment may still qualify for the Section 48E business energy credit. This can translate to lower lease payments or PPA rates for you.

- **Commercial Solar:** Businesses, churches, nonprofits, and farms installing solar for commercial purposes may still have access to business energy credits. Talk to a tax professional and your installer.

- **State and Local Incentives:** While West Virginia doesn't currently offer a state solar tax credit, some utilities offer net metering programs that credit you for excess electricity sent back to the grid.

## Does Solar Still Make Sense Without the Tax Credit?

The honest answer: **it depends on your situation, but for many WV homeowners, yes.**

Here's why:

### Utility Rates Keep Rising
West Virginia electricity rates have risen steadily. The more you pay per kWh now, the more valuable your solar production becomes over the system's 25-30 year lifespan.

### Panel Prices Have Dropped
Solar panel and inverter costs have fallen significantly over the past five years. Even without the ITC, installed costs per watt are lower than they were in 2020 *with* the credit.

### Payback Period Is Longer, But Still Viable
Without the 30% credit, a typical WV residential system might pay for itself in 12-16 years instead of 8-11 years. That's longer, but with panels warranted for 25 years, you're still looking at a decade or more of essentially free electricity after payback.

### Energy Independence Matters
For rural WV homeowners, especially those on farms or in areas with unreliable grid service, battery-backed solar provides real energy security regardless of tax credits.

## What Should You Do Now?

1. **[Use our calculator](/calculator/)** to get a realistic estimate based on current costs (with the ITC set to 0%).
2. **Get multiple quotes** — [we can match you with up to 3 vetted WV installers](/contact/) for free.
3. **Ask about leases and PPAs** — these may still offer savings through business credits passed along to you.
4. **Don't wait for incentives to return** — there's no current legislation to restore the residential credit, and utility rates are only going up.

## The Bottom Line

The loss of the 30% ITC makes solar a longer-term investment, but it doesn't make it a bad one. West Virginia homeowners who plan to stay in their homes for 15+ years can still save significant money over the life of a solar system. The key is getting accurate, honest quotes from experienced installers who know WV's terrain and grid.
