Choosing the right solar installer is one of the most important decisions you'll make when going solar. The installer determines your equipment quality, system design, pricing, warranty support, and overall experience.

Here's an overview of the solar companies actively serving West Virginia in 2026.

## Local WV-Based Installers

## How to Choose the Right Installer

### Get Multiple Quotes
This is the single most important piece of advice. Prices, equipment, and warranty terms vary significantly between installers. **Get at least 3 quotes** before making a decision.

### Check These Before Signing
- **Licensing:** Verify the company holds a valid WV contractor license.
- **Insurance:** Ask for proof of general liability and workers' compensation coverage.
- **Reviews:** Check Google Reviews, BBB, and Solar Reviews for the company.
- **Warranty:** Understand what's covered (panels, inverters, labor, production guarantee) and for how long.
- **Experience in WV:** Mountain terrain, weather, and utility interconnection rules are unique. Choose someone who knows the landscape.

### Questions to Ask Every Installer
1. How many systems have you installed in West Virginia?
2. What equipment brands do you use, and why?
3. What is your complete all-in price (not just equipment)?
4. What warranties do you provide on labor and workmanship?
5. How do you handle permitting and utility interconnection?
6. What is your timeline from contract to system activation?
7. Do you offer monitoring, and what happens if the system underperforms?

## Lease vs. Buy in 2026

With the residential ITC gone, leases and PPAs deserve a harder look:

- **Buying** gives you ownership, all the savings, and adds home value — but the upfront cost is higher without the tax credit.
- **Leasing/PPA** means lower (or no) upfront cost, and the leasing company may pass along business energy credit savings. You save less over 25 years but start saving from day one.

Ask each installer about both options and compare the total cost of ownership over 25 years.
